To get your voting app running from scratch without Docker Compose, follow these steps exactly. This assumes you have three folders (or locations) for MySQL, Backend, and Frontend.1. Prepare the NetworkSince containers need to talk to each other by name (e.g., the backend needs to find "mysql"), you must create a shared virtual network.Bashdocker network create voting-net
2. Start the Database (MySQL)We start this first so it can begin its initialization process.Bashdocker run -d \
  --name mysql \
  --network voting-net \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root \
  -e MYSQL_DATABASE=Voting \
  mysql:8.0
3. Set Up and Run the BackendCreate your folder: mkdir backend && cd backendFiles needed: index.js (with the code I gave you), package.json, and Dockerfile.Build and Run:Bash# Build the backend image
docker build -t voting-backend .

# Run the backend container
docker run -d \
  --name backend \
  --network voting-net \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  voting-backend
4. Set Up and Run the Frontend (Nginx)Create your folder: mkdir frontend && cd frontendFiles needed: index.html, style.css, nginx.conf, and Dockerfile.Build and Run:Bash# Build the frontend image
docker build -t voting-frontend .

# Run the frontend container
docker run -d \
  --name frontend \
  --network voting-net \
  -p 80:80 \
  voting-frontend
5. Verification StepsNow that all three containers are running, here is how to check if it's working:ActionHow to checkView WebsiteOpen your browser to http://localhostCheck Backend APIGo to http://localhost/api/votes (Nginx should proxy this to the backend)Check LogsRun docker logs backend to see if it says "Connected to MySQL"Check DatabaseRun docker exec -it mysql mysql -uroot -proot -e "USE Voting; SELECT * FROM votes;"Troubleshooting Common IssuesDatabase not ready: If the backend logs show "Retrying...", just wait. MySQL takes about 15–30 seconds to start the first time.404 on API: Ensure your nginx.conf has the location /api/ block exactly as written, including the trailing slashes.Data not saving: If you see "0 rows affected," make sure your initDb() function in index.js successfully ran and created the row with id=1.Would you like me to provide a "Cleanup Script" (a simple .sh or .bat file) that stops and removes all these containers so you can start fresh with one command?
