# AutoVoteOps: Production-Grade CI/CD Pipeline

## 🌟 Overview
**AutoVoteOps** is a **production‑grade DevOps automation project** that demonstrates how to design, deploy, and operate a fully automated CI/CD pipeline on AWS using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Containerization, and Kubernetes Orchestration**.

The project provisions cloud infrastructure from scratch, builds and versions Docker images, deploys applications to Kubernetes, supports **automated rollouts**, and enables **one‑click rollback** to previous versions.

- **Infrastructure as Code** using Terraform
- **Container orchestration** with Kubernetes (kubeadm cluster)
- **Automated CI/CD** pipelines with Jenkins
- **Microservices architecture** deployed on AWS
- **Database management** with AWS RDS MySQL
- **Automated cluster setup** with custom AMI, Shellscripting and S3 token sharing

### What This Project Demonstrates

✅ **Complete DevOps Lifecycle** - From infrastructure provisioning to application deployment  
✅ **Cloud-Native Architecture** - Microservices running on Kubernetes  
✅ **Automation** - Terraform for infrastructure, Jenkins for CI/CD  
✅ **Security Best Practices** - Private subnets, security groups, IAM roles  
✅ **Scalability** - Kubernetes deployments with replica management  
✅ **Real-World Patterns** - NAT Gateway, bastion host, RDS, container registry

### 🔹 Architecture Flow

1. Developer pushes code to GitHub

2. GitHub Webhook triggers Jenkins jobs

3. Jenkins builds Docker images on a dedicated Docker Builder EC2

4. Images are pushed to Docker Hub with version tags

5. Jenkins deploys updated images to Kubernetes (EC2‑based cluster)

6. Application connects securely to RDS MySQL

7. Traffic is routed via ALB DNS

8. Rollback job allows reverting to previous stable versions

## ⚡ Implementation Steps


### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sayaliparhar/AutoVoteOps.git
cd AutoVoteOps
```
---
### 2. Setup AWS Credentials

```bash
Setup AWS credentials using aws configure
 aws configure
# Enter your AWS Access Key ID
# Enter your AWS Secret Access Key
# Default region: ap-south-1
# Default output format: json
```
---

### 3. Deploy Infrastructure

```bash
cd Terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
```
**🏗️ This will create following resources**:
- Networking: VPC with Public & Private Subnets.

- Compute: 4 EC2 Instances (K8s Master, K8s Worker, Jenkins Server, Docker Builder).

- Database: RDS MySQL instance.

- Storage: S3 bucket for token sharing.

- Security: IAM Roles and Security Groups.
----
### 4. Manual Bootstrapping (One-Time Setup)
⚠️ Note: These steps are only required for the very first deployment to establish the baseline.

🔹 Step 1: Push Docker Images
- SSH into the Docker Builder instance via the Bastion Host.

- Clone the git repo 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sayaliparhar/AutoVoteOps.git
    cd AutoVoteOps
    ```
- Login to Docker Hub using a Personal Access Token (PAT).

- Build and push the frontend and backend images.

🔹 Step 2: Verify Kubernetes Cluster
- SSH into the K8s Master and run:

    ```bash
    kubectl get nodes
    kubectl get pods -n kube-system
    ```
- Ensure all nodes are Ready before proceeding.

🔹 Step 3: Verify Kubernetes Worker
- SSH into the K8s Worker and run:

    ```bash
    sudo crictl pods
    ```
- Ensure all pods are Ready before proceeding.

🔹 Step 4: Initial K8s Deployment
- On the K8s Master, prepare the environment for Jenkins agents:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sayaliparhar/AutoVoteOps.git
    mv AutoVoteOps/k8s /home/ubuntu/
    ```
- Deploy the resources in order: **Namespace ➔ Secrets ➔ ConfigMaps ➔ Backend ➔ Frontend**.

---
### 5. Setup Jenkins

```bash
# Get Jenkins URL
JENKINS_IP=$(terraform output -raw jenkins_public_ip)
echo "Jenkins URL: http://${JENKINS_IP}:8080"

# Get initial admin password
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@${JENKINS_IP} \
  "sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword"
```
🔹 Step 1: Jenkins Setup
- Install Suggested Plugins.

- Add Docker Hub Credentials in Manage Jenkins > Credentials.

- Configure Agents: Add nodes for docker-builder and k8s-master using their respective labels. (for correct labels you can check respective jenkins-file.)

🔹 Step 2: Create Jobs

| Job Name        | Trigger                  | Description                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend-Job    | GitHub Webhook           | Builds and pushes the frontend Docker image      |
| Backend-Job     | GitHub Webhook           | Builds and pushes the backend Docker image       |
| Deploy-to-K8s   | Post-build (Frontend-Job,Backend-Job)     | Deploys updated images to Kubernetes             |
| Rollback-Job    | Manual (parameterized)   | Rolls back deployments to a selected version     |

---

### 6. GitHub Webhook Integration
- To enable automated deployments:

- Navigate to your GitHub Repo Settings > Webhooks.

- Payload URL: http://<jenkins-ip>:8080/github-webhook/

- Content type: application/json

---

### 7. Deployment Verification
- Trigger Pipelines: Run the Backend Job, then the Frontend Job. Both will automatically trigger the Deployment Job.

- Monitor Update: Watch pods update in real-time:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -w -n <your-namespace>
    ```

- Access App: Open your ALB DNS endpoint in a browser.

- Confirm: Verify the UI loads and connects to the database.

- ✅ Result: AutoVoteOps is successfully deployed and fully automated!
---

### 8. Automation & Rollback
1. **Test Auto-Deploy**: Push a change to the code. Jenkins will trigger the build, push the image, and update the K8s pods automatically.

2. **Verify Pods**:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n <namespace>
    kubectl rollout history deployment <deployment-name>
    ```
3. **Test Rollback**: Run the Rollback-Job in Jenkins, select the previous version, and verify the app reverts to its prior state.

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

- **Kubernetes Cluster Communication**
  - Initial issues with master–worker node connectivity and security group rules.
  - Resolved by properly configuring inbound/outbound ports and private subnet routing.

- **Jenkins Agent Configuration**
  - Difficulty connecting Docker Builder and K8s Master as Jenkins agents.
  - Fixed by validating SSH keys, labels, and Java installation paths.

- **Docker Image Versioning**
  - Overwriting images caused rollback confusion.
  - Implemented semantic version tagging (`v1`, `v2`, etc.) to maintain history.

- **IAM Roles & Permissions**
  - Access denied errors while interacting with S3, RDS, and EC2.
  - Solved by attaching least-privilege IAM roles and validating policies.

- **Kubernetes Rollback Testing**
  - Rollbacks did not reflect immediately due to cached images.
  - Addressed using `imagePullPolicy: Always` and proper rollout commands.

---

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- **CI/CD Requires Clear Job Dependencies**
  - Chaining Jenkins jobs correctly prevents deployment conflicts and race conditions.

- **Networking & Security Matter**
  - Understanding VPC, subnets, and security groups is as important as application logic.

- **Automation Reduces Human Error**
  - Once webhooks and pipelines were configured, deployments became faster and more reliable.

- **Observability is Key**
  - Using `kubectl logs`, `describe`, and rollout history commands greatly improved debugging speed.

- **Rollback is Not Optional**
  - Having a tested rollback strategy increases production confidence and system reliability.

---

## 📈 Future Roadmap
- [ ] **Scalability:** Migrate from Kubeadm to **AWS EKS** for a managed, production-ready Control Plane.
- [ ] **Observability:** Integrate **Prometheus and Grafana** for real-time monitoring and alerting.
- [ ] **GitOps:** Transition to **ArgoCD** to automate deployment synchronization directly from Git.
- [ ] **Security:** Implement **HashiCorp Vault** for centralized and encrypted secret management.
